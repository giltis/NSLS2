# Module for the BNL image processing project
# Developed at the NSLS-II, Brookhaven National Laboratory
# Developed by Gabriel Iltis, Oct. 2013
"""
# This module contains the tools and functions required for basic image
arithmetic and logical operations. While the tools included are able to be
executed at the python interpreter prompt, or as part of a image processing
python script, the module has been designed to facilitate image arithmetic
and logical operations on image data sets in the VisTrails workflow manager.
